# Online-Shopping-Cart

An online shopping store, made in the second semester as complex engineering project of CS-116 Object oriented programming.
The project also contains graphical user interface and was made using the concepts of OOP Python and Tkinter library. 

This was the project assigned by our instructors to us 4 people that needed to be submitted to them by the deadline.
The GUI was not the mandatory requirement but we used the library to earn extra marks.
I, in collaboration with a brilliant student and a friend of mine, first made the overall structure and then started coding the whole project class by class.
The classes with functionalities like ordering and storing the customerâ€™s data really gave us a tough time.
But at the end of the day, it was indeed a great learning experience.
